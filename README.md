Ionic Demo Starter
=====================

A kitchen sink starter for the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com).

Demo: http://perrygovier.github.io/ionic-starter-demo/

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic start myProject https://github.com/perrygovier/ionic-starter-demo
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.

## Issues
This is for my own testing purposes. Feel free to submit issues, but I may never fix them. If they're issues with Ionic itself please create an issue on the [Ionic Framework GitHub repo](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic).
